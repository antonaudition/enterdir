# Entersekt Restful ls

A small little cross platform program in Java 8 that exposes a RESTful interface on port
8080 and allows a client application to do only one thing: obtain the full directory listing of a
given directory path on the local filesystem. Include the full path, file size and attribute
information in the result and cater for a directory size of at least 1 000 000.
